  summarize(Total_Count = sum(Count, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Name, values_from = Total_Count, values_fill = 0)
```

**DVS-6: I can create tables which make my summaries clear to the reader.**

-   Example 1

    Challenge 9 5.10

```{r dvs-6-1}
Allen_names_CA_PA |>
  #Find the sum of each Row

  mutate(
    across(.cols = c(Alan:Allen), 
           ~ .x/Total)
    ) |>
  subset(select = -c(Total)) |>
  gt() |>
  cols_label(Alan = "Ratio of Alans", Allan = "Ratio of Allans", 
             Allen = "Ratio of Allens") |>

```{r dvs-7-2}
Allen_names_CA_PA |>
  #Find the sum of each Row
  mutate(Total = pmap_int(list(Alan, Allan, Allen), sum)) |>
  #find ratio by dividing each count by the total count of each row
  mutate(
    across(.cols = c(Alan:Allen), 
           ~ .x/Total)
    ) |>

  cols_label(Alan = "Ratio of Alans", Allan = "Ratio of Allans", 
             Allen = "Ratio of Allens") |>
  fmt_percent(columns = 2:4, decimals = 2) 

```

## Program Efficiency

**PE-1: I can write concise code which does not repeat itself.**

-   using a single function call

    PA3 Part 2

```{r pe-1-one-call}
mystery_school <- colleges_clean |>
  filter(REGION == "7", ADM_RATE > median(ADM_RATE), TUITION_DIFF != 0,
         SAT_AVG %% 2 != 0, STABBR != "ID" & STABBR != "MT", 
         as.numeric(UGDS)/4 < 1000/ADM_RATE) |>
  arrange(TUITIONFEE_IN,TUITIONFEE_OUT)
```

-   `across()`

    Lab 3 Question 5 (revision)

```{r pe-1-across}
hiphop_clean <- hiphop |>
  select(-c(numPreferredArtists , numOverallArtists)) |>
  mutate(
    across( .cols = c(word , subj , sex , ethnic , familiarity , fam1 , jayz ,
                  jayz1 , barkley , boondocks , boondocks1 , monique , bieber) ,
           ~as.factor(.x))
  )
```

-   `map()` functions Lab 8 step 4

```{r pe-1-map-1}
1:12 |>
  map_chr( ~ sing_day(xmas2, .x, Full.Phrase)) |>
  cat()

```

**PE-2: I can write functions to reduce repetition in my code.**

-   Example 1 lab 8, pluralize gift

```{r pe2-1}
pluralize_gift <- function(gift){

  gift <- case_when( str_detect(gift, pattern = "oo") 
    ~ str_replace(string = gift, pattern = "oo", replacement =  "ee"),
    str_detect(gift, pattern = "y$") 
    ~ str_replace(string = gift, pattern = "y$", replacement = "ies"),
    TRUE ~ str_c(gift, "s", sep = ""))
  
return(gift)

}

```

-   Example 2 Lab 8, sing day

```{r pe2-2}
sing_day <- function(df, day, col){
  stopifnot(is.data.frame(df), is.numeric(day))
  #step 1: set up the intro line
  num_word <- english::ordinal(day)
  intro <- 
    glue::glue("On the {num_word} day of Christmas, my true love sent to me:")

  #step 2: sing the gift phrases
  phrases <- df |>
    pull({{col}})
  #put intro, then reverse order of phrases into lyrics
  lyrics <- c(intro, phrases[day:1])
  #step 3: put it all together
  #flatten phrases into 1 string separated by newlines, 
  #double newline at the end to seperate days
  output_string <- str_flatten(lyrics, collapse = "\n") |>
    str_c("\n\n") 
 return(output_string)
}
```

**PE-3:I can use iteration to reduce repetition in my code.**

-   `across()`

    Lab 3 Question 5 (revision)

```{r pe-3-across}
hiphop_clean <- hiphop |>
  select(-c(numPreferredArtists , numOverallArtists)) |>
  mutate(
    across( .cols = c(word , subj , sex , ethnic , familiarity , fam1 , jayz ,
                  jayz1 , barkley , boondocks , boondocks1 , monique , bieber) ,
           ~as.factor(.x))
  )

```

-   `map()` functions (Provide 2 Examples)

    Lab 8 Step 4

```{r pe-3-map-1}
1:12 |>
  map_chr( ~ sing_day(xmas2, .x, Full.Phrase)) |>
  cat()

```

Lab 8 step 2, make phrase

```{r pe-3-map-2}
xmas2 <- xmas %>%
  mutate(Full.Phrase = pmap_chr(.l = list(Day, Day,
                                          Gift.Item, Verb, 
                                          Adjective, Location), 
                                .f = make_phrase)
         )

```

**PE-4: I can use modern tools when carrying out my analysis.**

-   Example 1

    Lab 4 Question 7

```{r pe-4-1}
avocado_ratios <- four_cities |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Small_Hass":"Extra_Large_Hass"),
               names_to = "Avocado_Type",
               values_to = "Total") |>
  group_by(region,Avocado_Type, type) |>
  summarise(total = sum(Total))
```

-   Example 2

    Lab 3 Question 5 (revision)

```{r pe-4-2}
hiphop_clean <- hiphop |>
  select(-c(numPreferredArtists , numOverallArtists)) |>
  mutate(
    across( .cols = c(word , subj , sex , ethnic , familiarity , fam1 , jayz ,
                  jayz1 , barkley , boondocks , boondocks1 , monique , bieber) ,
           ~as.factor(.x))
  )
```

## Data Simulation & Modeling

**DSM-1: I can simulate data from a *variety* of probability models.**

-   Example 1

    Practice Activity 9.2 catching a con

```{r dsm-1-1}

music_man <- function(n_tromb, n_cor, n_reed){
  
  trombones <- sum(rnorm(n_tromb, mean = 4.6, sd = .8))
  cornets <- sum(runif(n_cor, min = 1.5, max = 3.5))
  reeds <- sum(rchisq(n_reed, df = 4))
  
  return(trombones + cornets + reeds)
  
}
```

-   Example 2

    Practice Activity 9.2, Warmup

```{r dsm-1-2}
qunif(p = .95, min = 1.5, max = 3.5)
qnorm(.10, mean = 4.6, sd = .8)
1-pnorm(q = 5, mean = 4.6, sd = .8)
1-pchisq(q = 5, df = 4)
sum(rnorm(n = 100, mean = 4.6, sd = .8)<4)

```

**DSM-2: I can fit a linear regression and extract necessary summary measures.**

-   Example 1

    Lab 9 4.4 and 4.6

```{r dsm-2-1}
linear_model <- lm(total_count ~ Year, data = count_by_year)
linear_model |>
  broom::augment() |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = .resid, x = .fitted)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Residuals by Fitted Values", y = NULL, x = "Fitted Values")
```

-   Example 2

    Practice Activity 9.1

```{r dsm-2-2}
linear_model <- lm(weight_after ~ weight_before, data = dataset)

linear_model |>
  broom::augment() |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = .resid, x = .fitted)) +
  geom_point()

```

## Revising My Thinking

<!-- How did you revise your thinking throughout the course? How did you revise your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

Every Week, I have tried to revise my thinking by resubmitting Labs and Challenges that I did not get full credit on. However, I have been trying to incorporate corrections into new assignments, such as improving with visualizations and slicing to find max values in summaries. Additionally, some of the examples provided are revisions so that they can better show my abilities and attainment of learning objectives.

## Extending My Thinking

<!-- How did you extended your thinking throughout the course? How did you extend your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

I wouldn't say that I have extended My thinking too often, but I always try to make use of outside sources in my code. For example, in Practice Activity 4, I used the "replace()" function to replace all instances of ".." or "xxx" to NA. Although I forgot to cite the page I found it on, I thought this method was much easier than using mutate() and if_else() and was much easier to read. Additionally, I use outside sources to help with labeling Visualizations, such as in Lab 4 when labeling the visualization of proportion of Avocados sold.
